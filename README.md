## :scroll: Description

Find puppies for adoption from multiple pet associations. You can request the adoption of your favourite pet.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context

I'm quite happy with how the look and feel of the app turned out. I wanted to convey the most important information without cluttering the ui.

I'm happy I managed to add some animations that look smooth and clean.
